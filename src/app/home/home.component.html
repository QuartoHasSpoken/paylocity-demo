<p>This happens to be the most fantastic employee entry system.</p>
<p>Given that all your employees make ${{env.payRate}} / pay period and there are {{env.payPeriods}} pay periods a year</p>

<p>You currently have {{ employeeCount }} employee(s) with a total of {{ dependentCount }} dependent(s)</p>

<h3>Total Cost of Salary :: {{ salaryTotal | currency }}</h3>
<h3>Total Cost Of Benefits :: {{ benefitTotal | currency }}</h3>
<h2>Total Annual Cost :: {{ salaryTotal + benefitTotal | currency }}</h2>

<app-employee (onEmployeesUpdate)="employeesUpdate($event)"></app-employee>
