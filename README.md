# Paylocity Calc

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.0.6.

All you really need to do is install the dependencies, spin up the demo api server and run the app.

Run `npm install`

## Api server

Definitely need to spin this up to emulate a simple RESTful client for the employees object

Run `npm run server`

This will be on `http://localhost:3000` if you want to verify it is up

## Generate / Manage Demo Data

You can opt to pre-populate the data. If you watch /server/database.json you will see the changes made
and you can also update the json here and refresh the app

Run `npm run generate`

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`.
